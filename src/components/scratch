          Fell in love with climbing when I walked into a local climbing gym as
          part of a dare with my oldest sister. Little did I know what I was
          getting myself into, for before long I was at the gym 3-4 days a week.
          Over a decade later and it is now hard to remember life before
          climbing. It has pushed my life into new and exciting directions,
          introduced me to some of the most thoughtful and interesting people I
          know, and provided numerous opportunities to grow, challenge, and
          prove myself. It has placed me in amazing locales from El Capitan in
          Yosemite Valley to Nowra, Australia as well as introduced to me hidden
          gems all across the southeastern United States. Oh, and it’s just too
          much fun.

          I was first introduced to trail riding while on a rest day during a
          climbing trip. I was instantly hooked and decided to add it to my list
          of activities. It’s a bit riskier than climbing but it offers many
          rewards and amazing fitness if you are willing to assume said risk.
          The flow state you enter into when riding well is hard to beat and,
          just as with climbing, the sport takes you to some of the most
          beautiful locations and introduces you to very interesting people.

          I began road cycling only a few years ago as a way to balance the
          impact of running on my legs. It became even more critical after a
          severe climbing injury prevented me from running for a year or two.
          While it does not offer the thrills and general fun that trail riding
          provides, it possesses far less risk and offers arguably the best
          complimentary fitness of any of my activities. Plus the social element
          of group and team rides are great.
